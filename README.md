# Azure SDKs and Samples for Unity

### This project is no longer under active development

This is a series of experimenal Unity SDKs, samples, and documentation for using [Azure Services](https://aka.ms/azfreegamedev) with Unity 2017 or 2018 thanks to Unity's support of .NET Standard and SSL/TLS fixes.
